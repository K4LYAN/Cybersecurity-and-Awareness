# Cybersecurity-and-Awareness
## This project develops a user-friendly web portal to enhance cyber security education. It features role-based dashboards, secure authentication, and robust security measures to prevent common web vulnerabilities.

## 🎯 The Problem
### Current cybersecurity training platforms often suffer from:
- **Limited hands-on** practical training opportunities.
- Lack of integrated **virtual laboratory** environments.
- Fragmented **learning** resources, requiring users to switch between multiple platforms.
- Poor integration between theoretical **knowledge and practical** application skills.
- This platform aims to solve these challenges by creating a single, unified, and interactive **training environment**.

## ✨ Key Features
### This platform is a multi-modular system built to serve three distinct user roles: Students, Teachers, and Administrators.
- **Course Management:** A complete module for Teachers to create, update, and schedule cybersecurity courses, including multimedia-based content like videos and quizzes.
- **Virtual Laboratory Module:** Provides sandboxed environments where learners can safely perform real-world cybersecurity tasks, experiments, and simulations (e.g., attack and defense scenarios) without risk to live systems.
- **CTF (Capture The Flag) Challenges:** Includes gamified learning modules where students can test their skills by finding "flags" in various challenges.
- **AI-Powered Assistance:** Integrates AI to offer personalized learning paths, real-time doubt resolution, and intelligent recommendations.
### Career Hub:
- **Job Assistance Portal:** Lists relevant cybersecurity job openings and internships, along with resume-building tools.
- **Research Paper Repository:** A centralized library for scholarly articles, white papers, and industry reports.
- **Feedback System:** A comprehensive module for users to submit feedback for continuous platform improvement

### Security Enhancements:
- SQL Injection prevention using prepared statements.
- XSS and HTML Injection mitigation via sanitization and output encoding.
- Input validation and escaping.
### Performance: 
- Integrated CDN for faster image loading.
## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Backend:** Secure web technologies.
- **Database:** Normalized schema for efficient data management.
